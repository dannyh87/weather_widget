**Finding the Website's Home**: First, I peeked behind the scenes of the National Trust website's code to pinpoint its exact location (latitude and longitude). Think of it like finding the website's address on a giant map.

**Weather Whisperer**: With this location in hand, I talked to a special service (called an API) that tells you all about the weather. It's like asking a personal weather expert for the forecast specific to where the website lives.

**Familiar Faces**: The data I received from this expert even included an icon to represent the weather – sunny, rainy, or cloudy, just like the symbols you see on weather apps.

**Building a Mini-Guide**: Using all this information, I created a new mini-program on the website itself – a little box that shows the weather right there. This is what we call a widget.

**Just the Right Spot**: I then carefully placed the widget at a specific location within the National Trust website's code. Imagine putting a weather notice on a specific page of a visitor guide.

**Testing Time**: To see how people interact with the weather widget, I decided to only show it to half of the website visitors. This lets us compare how people using the website with and without the widget behave. I'll be tracking clicks and other data to see which version works best.

**Making it Official**: After a set time period, I'll compare the information gathered from both sets of visitors. This will help us decide if the weather widget is a helpful addition to the National Trust website.
